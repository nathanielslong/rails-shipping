# rails-shipping

Welcome to Ship to Shore, a service for boat owners to get some spare money from people needing cargo moved!

List your job, the amount of containers to be moved, and the price you're willing to pay, and wait for a boat to accept your job.

If you have a boat, list your boat and accept jobs at your origin port.

Site online at shiptoshore.herokuapp.com. Made with Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, Jquery, Sass, and other assorted smaller quantities.
